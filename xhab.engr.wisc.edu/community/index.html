<h2>Outreach</h2>

<p>As students at the University of Wisconsin, the team aspires to embody the tradition that is the Wisconsin Idea: 
the notion that education is never for personal gain alone and the privilege of a world-class education carries the responsibility to 
influence the world beyond the classroom. Because of the potential significance and weight that the project carries, it is the team's duty to inform others and 
extend the influences of additive manufacturing and emerging space technologies. </p>

<p>Keeping with this philosophy, throughout the course of the project, research and progress will be presented at primary schools, secondary schools, conferences, and educational 
events throughout the Midwest. In collaboration with the Wisconsin Space Grant Consortium and the University of Wisconsin American Institute for Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) chapter, 
engaging programs will be created as a part of aerospace outreach and special initiatives projects. During the course of research, design, and project construction, local middle school and 
high school students are invited to take part in interacting with the work. Collaborative work with various journals and newspapers can inform a larger demographic of people about the project, 
expanding outreach in media both throughout the state and the Midwest. </p>

<p>The team is grateful for this opportunity to engage the community in the developments of 3D printing, astronautics, and space exploration through the sponsorship of NASA, and believes that both the 
process and results ought to benefit the greatest number of people possible.</p>

<h3>Deep Space - Epic's 2013 User's Group Meeting, September 19, 2013</h3>
<p>In collaboration with the Wisconsin Institutes for Discovery (WID) and the UW-Madison 2011 X-Hab project, the team will present current information about the project, demonstrate the capabilities of additive manufacturing, and inform guests about the current state of deep space habitat research. The team and WID will have a 3D printer and printed parts on display to show the printing technique and result of simple fused deposition modeling (FDM). Guests will be able to watch videos and slideshows about both the 2011 and 2013 X-Hab projects and interact with the students.</p>

<h3>Da Vinci Days - K thru 12 Science Fair Event, January 10-11, 2014</h3>

<p>Over the winter recess, four members of the Badger COMET team made the journey to Sillwater, MN to attend 
the Da Vinci Fest Science and Art Fair, an annual event held at the local high school. Students, as well as 
hundreds of community members throughout the Twin Cities area attend the event, showcasing events ranging
from high school projects to local business's newest products. The team also took this opportunity to present 
to the senior physics class at the high school and was very happy with the level of interest exhibited by the
students. Photos from the event can be found on our images page. </p>

<p>If you would like to know more about the project, have the team present at your event, or write a feature about the team in your publication, please contact Steve Wishau (<a href="mailto:wishau@wisc.edu">wishau@wisc.edu</a>) or Dr. Frederick Elder (<a href="mailto:elder@engr.wisc.edu">elder@engr.wisc.edu</a>) for more information. </p>
