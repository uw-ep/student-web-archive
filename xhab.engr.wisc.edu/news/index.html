<h3>News</h3>

<h4>January 10-11, 2014 | Da Vinci Days Outreach, Stillwater, MN</h4>
<p>Over the winter recess, four members of the Badger COMET team made the journey to Sillwater, MN to attend 
the Da Vinci Fest Science and Art Fair, an annual event held at the local high school. Students, as well as 
hundreds of community members throughout the Twin Cities area attend the event, showcasing events ranging
from high school projects to local business's newest products. The team also took this opportunity to present 
to the senior physics class at the high school and was very happy with the level of interest exhibited by the
students. Photos from the event can be found on our images page. </p>

<h4>January 9, 2014 | NASA Critical Design Review (CDR) Presentation</h4>
<p>The Badger COMET team recently completed another constructive meeting with NASA over the winter recess. The 
team discussed the final design plans and received helpful feedback to help move forward into the next stage
of the project. The team is excited to start prototyping their design that has been months in the making, and
 looks forward to NASA's feedback at the next checkpoint. </p>
 
<h4>December 22, 2013 | Four Members Graduate from UW-Madison</h4>
<p>Four members of the Badger COMET team graduated this December from the University of Wisconsin - Madison's 
College of Engineering. The team is very proud of their accomplishments and are happy to have their continued 
assistance and knowledge in completing this project. The four team members are given below:<br>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alex Schwartz</strong> - B.S. Engineering Mechanics, B.S. Computer Sciences<br>
Alex is continuing his education path by pursuing his masters in Engineering Mechanics at UW-Madison
beginning in January, 2014. </li>
<li><strong>Sean Kelly</strong> - B.S. Engineering Mechanics and Astronautics, B.S. Mathematics<br>
Sean is continuing his education path by pursuing his masters in Engineering Mechanics at UW-Madison
beginning in January, 2014. </li>
<li><strong>Reid Carlson</strong> - B.S. Engineering Mechanics and Astronautics, B.S. Economics<br>
Reid is assisting the group and has plans to further his education in the Fall 2014 semester. </li>
<li><strong>Steve Wishau</strong> - B.S. Engineering Mechanics and Astronautics<br>
Steve is assisting the group while being employed in the area.</li>
</ul>

<h4>November 12, 2013 | NASA Preliminary Design Review (PDR) Presentation</h4>
<p>On Thursday, November 7th, the Badger COMET team presented the latest process of the 
project to NASA via teleconference in the Preliminary Design Review, 
marking the second official meeting the group has had with NASA representatives to present 
their project. The group presented models of the design and concepts of the project, 
as well as gave updates on the research and testing conducted thus far. This 
was followed by a very informative Q/A session to receive feedback from the NASA representatives. The 
team will now continue to move forward with the design and prepare for the next 
presentation with NASA, is scheduled to take place in early December. </p>

<h4>September 24, 2013 | NASA System Definition Review (SDR) Presentation</h4>
<p>Badger COMET discussed design mechanics and firmware development requirements; through this interaction, invaluable knowledge was 
gained through interaction with NASA and other sponsors.  Design improvements are next on the docket and will be implemented and finalized
for the upcoming Preliminary Design Review (PDR) scheduled currently for the end of October. </p>

<h4>September 19, 2013 | Deep Space - Epic's 2013 Users' Group Meeting</h4>
<p>In collaboration with the Wisconsin Institutes for Discovery (WID) and the UW-Madison 2011 X-Hab project, the team presented
current information about the project, demonstrated the capabilities of FDM, and informed guests about the 
current state of deep space habitat research.  The 3D printer and printed parts were displayed to show
the printing technique.  </p>

<h4>September 15, 2013 | COMET In The News: Badger Herald</h4>
<p>The Badger Herald, a newspaper based in Madison, WI,  wrote an article about the project and its potential impact on the general community
and industry in general.  Full Article can be found here: <a target="_blank" href="http://badgerherald.com/news/2013/09/15/uw-comet-project-looks-to-take-off-to-space/">http://badgerherald.com/news/2013/09/15/uw-comet-project-looks-to-take-off-to-space/</a></p>
